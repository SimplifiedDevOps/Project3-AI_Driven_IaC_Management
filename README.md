# AI-Driven Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Management System

## Project Overview

The AI-Driven IaC Management System automates the creation, validation, deployment, and monitoring of cloud infrastructure configurations. Using a combination of OpenAI's language model, LangChain, and AWS CloudWatch, this system allows for seamless Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) management with integrated feedback loops for continuous learning and optimization.

## Key Features

- **IaC Template Generation**: Automatically generates Terraform templates based on prompts, using LangChain and OpenAI for flexible template creation.
- **Template Validation**: Validates generated templates by comparing them with existing IaC documentation to ensure compliance and accuracy.
- **Automated Deployment Workflow**: Executes multi-step deployment workflows, including template validation, application, and real-time monitoring.
- **Deployment Monitoring**: Tracks resource health and performance using AWS CloudWatch, with automated alerting for errors.
- **Feedback-Based Learning**: Collects operator feedback after each deployment to improve template generation, validation checks, and retrieval accuracy over time.

## Requirements

- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- **Terraform CLI** (for applying templates)
- **AWS CLI** (configured with access to required AWS services)
- **OpenAI API Key**
- **Pinecone API Key** (or Faiss if using local storage for vector embeddings)
- **Boto3** (for AWS CloudWatch and SNS)
- **LangChain** (for managing prompt templates and workflows)
- **Additional Python Libraries**: See `requirements.txt`

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/AI_Driven_IaC_Management.git
cd AI_Driven_IaC_Management
```
## Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configure Environment Variables
Set up environment variables for the OpenAI and Pinecone API keys:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
export PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key"
export PINECONE_ENV="your_pinecone_environment"
```

## Configure AWS CLI
Configure AWS credentials with appropriate access to CloudWatch, SNS, and any other AWS services used by the system:

```bash
aws configure
```
## Set Up Vector Database
Run the setup script to initialize the vector database for storing IaC documentation embeddings:

```bash
python scripts/setup_vector_db.py
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Generating IaC Templates
To generate a Terraform template for an infrastructure component (e.g., EC2 instance):

```bash
python scripts/iac_template_generation.py
```

### 2. Validating IaC Templates
To validate a generated template by comparing it to existing documentation:

```bash
Copy code
python scripts/validate_templates.py
```

### 3. Running Deployment Workflow
To initiate the deployment workflow, including template generation, validation, application, and monitoring:

```bash
Copy code
python scripts/deployment_workflow.py
```

### 4. Monitoring Deployment
To monitor the status of a deployed resource using AWS CloudWatch:

```bash
Copy code
python scripts/deployment_monitoring.py
```

### 5. Collecting Feedback
To collect feedback from operators post-deployment:

```bash
Copy code
python scripts/feedback_collection.py
```

### 6. Learning from Feedback
To analyze feedback data and update the systemâ€™s templates or vector store entries:

```bash
Copy code
python scripts/feedback_based_learning.py
```

### 7. Running Integration Tests
To verify that each component of the deployment workflow functions as expected:

```bash
Copy code
python scripts/integration_test.py
```
## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Set Up Core Components
- **Initialize Vector Database**: Set up Pinecone (or Faiss) to store IaC documentation embeddings for retrieval.
- **Preprocess IaC Documentation**: Load and embed IaC documentation into the vector database to support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) during template validation.

### Stage 2: Develop the IaC Agent
- **Template Generation**: Define prompt templates in LangChain to generate Terraform templates based on operator requests.
- **Template Validation**: Use RAG to retrieve relevant IaC documentation and compare it with generated templates, suggesting corrections as needed to ensure accuracy.

### Stage 3: Multi-Step Deployment Automation
- **Deployment Workflow**: Develop a multi-step LangChain workflow to validate, apply, and monitor Terraform templates.
- **Deployment Monitoring**: Integrate AWS CloudWatch and SNS for monitoring deployed resources and sending alerts in case of deployment issues.

### Stage 4: Feedback Loop for Continuous Learning and Optimization
- **Feedback Collection**: Set up a feedback form to capture ratings and comments from operators after each deployment.
- **Feedback-Based Learning**: Analyze feedback data to refine prompt templates, validation checks, and retrieval accuracy.

### Stage 5: Testing and Finalizing the System
- **Integration Testing**: Test each component of the deployment workflow to ensure seamless integration.
- **Workflow Optimization**: Fine-tune prompt templates, retrieval settings, and deployment sequences for efficiency.
- **Production Deployment**: Deploy the AI-driven IaC system in a production environment and monitor its performance, capturing feedback for continuous improvement.

## Additional Notes

- **Scalability**: To support larger infrastructures or higher deployment frequencies, consider scaling the vector store (Pinecone) and optimizing AWS CloudWatch and SNS configurations.
- **Security**: Ensure that all sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) is secured and not hardcoded in scripts.
- **Future Enhancements**: Consider integrating more advanced monitoring or extending the system to support multi-cloud deployments.

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Slow Retrieval**: If retrieval from the vector store is slow, consider adjusting the `top_k` parameter or caching frequently used documents.
- **AWS Permissions**: Ensure that the AWS IAM role or user has the necessary permissions for CloudWatch, SNS, and any other required services.
- **OpenAI Rate Limits**: Monitor OpenAI API usage and ensure rate limits are not exceeded. Consider using batching where possible.

## Conclusion
The AI-Driven IaC Management System provides an end-to-end solution for infrastructure management, utilizing AI and automation to streamline the IaC lifecycle. By integrating feedback-based learning, the system continuously improves its accuracy and efficiency, delivering reliable and optimized infrastructure configuration
